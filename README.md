MemeMe App

This is the second project for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree course. This is an iPhone app which allows you to take a photo, add top and bottom texts to a photo to form a meme and share it with your friends via Facebook, Twitter, email or messaging, or to save it. The app also allows you to add texts to photos that are already in the gallery. Memes are presented on the tab view with 2 tabs: a table view and a collection view.
